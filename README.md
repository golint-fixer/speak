*Standing on the sholders of dragons.*

Speak is an experimental compiler construction playground. Inspired by [Gocc](https://github.com/goccmack/gocc), [Participle](https://github.com/alecthomas/participle) and [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/), Speak parses input by runtime evaluation of language grammars expressed in EBNF.

The name *Speak* is derived from the pronunciation of the Swedish word *spik*, in commemoration of my father Peter Eklind who worked with nail guns (or *spikpistoler* in Swedish) for the better part of his life.
